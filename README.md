### Claude Code Integration

Launch [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) directly from scan results to get AI-assisted fixes:

- Enable in Settings > Claude Code Integration
- Issue context (file, line, type, message) is passed automatically
- Add custom instructions to customize the AI prompt
- Requires [claude-code CLI](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) installed
- Opens in Windows Terminal on Windows; on Linux it asks `xdg-terminal-exec`
  for the desktop's default terminal first and falls back to alacritty, ghostty,
  kitty, foot and the common desktop terminals; on other platforms the dock
  reports that it cannot open a terminal and prints the command to run by hand

**Interaction Options:**

| Action | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Click** | Launch Claude Code in plan mode (safe - reviews before making changes) |
| **Shift+Click** | Launch Claude Code in immediate mode (fixes without planning) |
| **Right-click** | Context menu with "Plan Fix" and "Fix Immediately" options |

Hover over any Claude icon to see a tooltip with these options.

### CLI Support

Run analysis from command line for CI/CD integration:

```bash
# Analyze current project
godot --headless --script res://addons/gdscript-linter/analyzer/analyze-cli.gd

# Analyze external project
godot --headless --path /path/to/gdscript-linter --script res://addons/gdscript-linter/analyzer/analyze-cli.gd -- --path "C:/my/project"

# Output formats
godot --headless --script res://addons/gdscript-linter/analyzer/analyze-cli.gd -- --clickable  # Godot Output panel format
godot --headless --script res://addons/gdscript-linter/analyzer/analyze-cli.gd -- --json       # JSON format
godot --headless --script res://addons/gdscript-linter/analyzer/analyze-cli.gd -- --html -o report.html  # HTML report

# Audit mode - bypass all ignore directives
godot --headless --script res://addons/gdscript-linter/analyzer/analyze-cli.gd -- --no-ignore
```

**Exit Codes:**
- `0` - No issues found
- `1` - Warnings only
- `2` - Critical issues found

## Prerequisites

For the editor dock and the analyzer CLI, Godot is the only requirement. The
shell workflow (`copy.sh`, the generated `lint.sh`, the test suite) needs more,
and every script involved checks what it needs and stops with the name of what
is missing rather than failing deep inside a build log.

On Arch / Omarchy, with mise:

```bash
sudo pacman -S godot-mono    # everything: the dock and the analyzer CLI
mise use -g rust             # 1.85+, only to build the formatter
sudo pacman -S base-devel    # cc, only to build the formatter; usually present already
mise use -g bun              # only for this repository's test suite
```

The mono package installs its editor as `godot-mono` on PATH, which the lint
script and the test suite find by name alongside `godot`. Rust from rustup
(https://rustup.rs) works instead of mise, and on macOS the C compiler comes
with the Xcode command line tools. `GODOT=/path/to/godot` pins a specific
Godot binary if several are installed.

The formatter is the one dependency that is not a package. The index-backed
checks (listed in the options table of `addons/gdscript-linter/docs/CLI.md`)
read source structure from `gdscript-formatter index`, a sub-command that only exists on
the fork. Check it out beside this repository:

```bash
git clone -b nojaf https://github.com/nojaf/GDScript-formatter
```

The scripts find it there, build it, and verify the binary can do the job;
`scripts/install-formatter.sh` explains itself if anything above is missing.
Rust and the C compiler are only needed to build the formatter. The built
binary stands alone, and `cargo install --path .` from that checkout puts it
on PATH permanently if you would rather not rebuild on every run.

## Installation

### From Asset Library

1. Open Godot Editor
2. Go to AssetLib tab
3. Search for "GDScript Linter"
4. Download and install
5. Enable plugin: Project > Project Settings > Plugins > GDScript Linter > Enable

### Manual Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Copy the `addons/gdscript-linter` folder to your project's `addons/` directory
3. Enable plugin: Project > Project Settings > Plugins > GDScript Linter > Enable

## Usage

### Editor Dock

1. After enabling the plugin, find "Code Quality" in the bottom panel
2. Click "Scan" to analyze your codebase
3. Click any issue to navigate to the source location
4. Use filters to focus on specific severity levels or issue types
5. Click the settings icon to adjust thresholds

### Ignore Comments

Suppress warnings for intentional code patterns using inline comments:

| Directive                      | Scope           |
|--------------------------------|-----------------|
| `gdlint:ignore-file`             | Entire file     |
| `gdlint:ignore-below`            | Line to EOF     |
| `gdlint:ignore-function`         | Entire function |
| `gdlint:ignore-block-start/end`  | Code block      |
| `gdlint:ignore-next-line`        | Next line       |
| `gdlint:ignore-line`             | Same line       |

All directives support optional check IDs: `# gdlint:ignore-line:magic-number,print-statement`

#### Pinned Exceptions

Track technical debt regression by pinning numeric values:

```gdscript
# gdlint:ignore-function:long-function=35
func my_complex_function():
    # Function is 35 lines - pinned at this value
```

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Actual matches pinned (35 = 35) | Silently ignored |
| Actual exceeds pinned (35 → 40) | ⚠️ Warning: "exceeded pinned limit" |
| Actual improved (35 → 32, still > 30) | ℹ️ Info: "consider tightening" |
| Actual now within limit (35 → 25) | ℹ️ Info: "pinned ignore is now unnecessary" |

See **[IGNORE_RULES.md](addons/gdscript-linter/docs/IGNORE_RULES.md)** for full syntax reference and examples.

### Defensive Attributes

Three attributes for enforcing stricter contracts on critical code.

#### `#@ascii_only` — ASCII Enforcement

Place in the first 10 lines of a file to flag non-ASCII characters (including in strings and comments) as warnings.

```gdscript
#@ascii_only
extends Node

var name := "hello"   # OK
var label := "héllo"  # WARNING: ascii-violation
```

Enable project-wide with `ascii_only_project_wide = true` in `.gdlint.cfg`. Individual files can opt out with `# gdlint:ignore-file:ascii-violation`.

#### `# gdlint:strict` — Per-Scope Tighter Limits

Override global thresholds with stricter values. Issues fire at CRITICAL severity and suppress the normal threshold check.

```gdscript
# File-scoped (first 10 lines):
# gdlint:strict-file:file-length=200

# Function-scoped (above func):
# gdlint:strict-function:long-function=25
func critical_function():
    pass
```

Supported rules: `long-function`, `file-length`, `high-complexity`, `deep-nesting`, `too-many-params`, `god-class-functions`, `god-class-signals`

#### `#@Sealed` — Prevent Class Inheritance

Mark a class as sealed to prevent other files from extending it. Requires `class_name` on the next line and directory-wide analysis.

```gdscript
#@Sealed
class_name CoreAPI
extends RefCounted
# Other files extending CoreAPI will get a CRITICAL sealed-violation
```

See **[IGNORE_RULES.md](addons/gdscript-linter/docs/IGNORE_RULES.md)** for full details on all defensive attributes.

### Project Configuration

Create a `.gdlint.cfg` file in your project root to customize settings:

```ini
[limits]
file_lines_soft = 200
file_lines_hard = 300
function_lines = 30
function_lines_critical = 60
max_parameters = 4
max_nesting = 3
cyclomatic_warning = 10
cyclomatic_critical = 15
ascii_only_project_wide = false

[checks]
file_length = true
function_length = true
cyclomatic_complexity = true
parameters = true
nesting = true
todo_comments = true
print_statements = true
empty_functions = true
magic_numbers = true
commented_code = true
missing_types = true
god_class = true
naming_conventions = true
unused_variables = true
unused_parameters = true
ignore_underscore_prefix = true
ascii_only = true
sealed_classes = true

[scanning]
scan_addons = false
included_addons = gdscript-linter, my-other-addon
excluded_addons = some-third-party-addon

[exclude]
paths = addons/, .godot/, tests/mocks/
```

**Scan Options precedence:**

| `included_addons` | `scan_addons` | Result |
|---|---|---|
| non-empty | any | Scan ONLY the listed addons |
| empty | true | Scan all addons except `excluded_addons` |
| empty | false | Scan no addons (default) |

## Allowed Magic Numbers

These numbers are not flagged as they are commonly self-explanatory:
`0, 1, -1, 2, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5, 2.0, -1.0, 10, 60, 90, 100, 180, 255, 360`

## Requirements

- Godot 4.0+
- GDScript only (no C# support)

What the analyzed project needs, as opposed to what the tooling needs; see
